As a part of the OCR Assignment, you have to create bounding boxes for each line in the Sanskrit text 
that is provided in the attached file. After the bounding box is created for the entire line 
(and not the words), you need to save each line in separate jpg files and send us the output.

Additionally, you need to save the coordinates of the bounding box in a JSON format as shown below:

{
"box1": {
"top_left": [0, 0],
"top_right": [0, 10],
"bottom_left": [10, 0],
"bottom_right": [10, 10]
},
"box2": {
     ....
}
}
